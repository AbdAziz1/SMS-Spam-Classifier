# Email/SMS Spam Detection

This project aims to develop a robust machine-learning model for classifying email/SMS messages as either spam or not spam. The project consists of several key components, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and deployment as a Streamlit web application.

## Key Features:

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and restructuring columns for effective analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insightful visualizations are generated to understand the distribution of spam and non-spam messages, as well as key characteristics such as message length and word frequency.

- **Text Preprocessing**: Text data is preprocessed using techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, removal of stopwords and punctuation, and stemming to prepare it for model training.

- **Model Building**: Various machine learning algorithms are explored and evaluated for their effectiveness in classifying spam messages. Models include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, among others.

- **Model Deployment**: The best-performing model is deployed as a Streamlit web application, allowing users to input messages and receive real-time predictions on whether they are spam or not spam.

## Technologies Used:
